# Neural-Network-for-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-TensorFlow
To run the handwritten digit recognition code using TensorFlow, follow these steps:
Dont Forget to Run Import os otherwise it will throw error while running the import warnings code.
Install the required dependencies: TensorFlow, NumPy, and Matplotlib,scipy.io.
Run the handwritten_digit_recognition.py script.
The script will train the neural network for 40 epochs and print the loss after each epoch.
The script will also compare the predictions vs the labels for a random sample of 64 digits.
Note: The code requires the MNIST dataset, which is not included in the repository. You can download the dataset from the following link: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. Once downloaded, extract the dataset and place it in the same directory as the handwritten_digit_recognition.py script.
